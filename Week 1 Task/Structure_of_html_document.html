    <p>
    I am a passionate and detail-oriented Web Developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications that deliver excellent performance and functionality. My journey started with mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve continuously expanded my skills to include Bootstrap, <em>WordPress</em> (with Elementor), and backend development. I am proficient in creating dynamic and visually appealing websites while ensuring clean, maintainable code and seamless user experiences. <br>
    With a solid understanding of UI/UX principles, I strive to bridge the gap between design and development. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating with teams, and staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.</p> <br>
